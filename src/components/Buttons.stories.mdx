# Buttons

Buttons are used to trigger actions within an application.

## Usage

Buttons are used to trigger internal actions within your web applications.

## Primary Buttons

Primary buttons are used as a call to action and indicate the most important action on a page.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story name="primary">
    <PrimaryButton disabled={boolean("disabled", false)} onClick={action('button-click')} >Primary</PrimaryButton>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Secondary Buttons

Seondary buttons provide additional usability, I use them for events that direct users to other pages

<Story name="secondary">
  <SecondaryButton>Secondary</SecondaryButton>
</Story>

## Tertiary Buttons

Tertiary buttons are less common, they're used for miscellaneous actions on a page

<Story name="tertiary">
  <TertiaryButton>Tertiary</TertiaryButton>
</Story>
